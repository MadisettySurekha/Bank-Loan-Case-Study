## [Project Overview](Project-Overview)
When a customer applies for a loan, your company faces two risks:

If the applicant can repay the loan but is not approved, the company loses business.
If the applicant cannot repay the loan and is approved, the company faces a financial loss.
The dataset you'll be working with contains information about loan applications. It includes two types of scenarios:

Customers with payment difficulties: These are customers who had a late payment of more than X days on at least one of the first Y installments of the loan.
All other cases: These are cases where the payment was made on time.
When a customer applies for a loan, there are four possible outcomes:

Approved: The company has approved the loan application.
Cancelled: The customer cancelled the application during the approval process.
Refused: The company rejected the loan.
Unused Offer: The loan was approved but the customer did not use it.

## [Data Analytics Tasks](Data-Analytics-Tasks)
- [Task-1](Task-1): Identify the missing data in the dataset and decide on an appropriate method to deal with it using Excel built-in functions and features.
- [Task-2](Task-2): Detect and identify outliers in the dataset using Excel statistical functions and features, focusing on numerical variables.
- [Task-3](Task-3): Determine if there is data imbalance in the loan application dataset and calculate the ratio of data imbalance using Excel functions.
- [Task-4](Task-4): Perform univariate analysis to understand the distribution of individual variables, segmented univariate analysis to compare variable distributions for different scenarios, and bivariate analysis to explore relationships between variables and the target variable using Excel functions and features.
- [Task-5](Task-5): Segment the dataset based on different scenarios (e.g., clients with payment difficulties and all other cases) and identify the top correlations for each segmented data using Excel functions.
  
## [Microsoft Excel](Microsoft-Excel)
- In Microsoft Excel, we need to perform EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis)
- Perform conditional formatting and then Data Analysis tool kit.

## [Conclusion](Conclusion)
Conclusions: After performing the analysis ,we can rectify whether a client will repay the loan or not. Also, the people who are likely to face problem in loan repayment are labourers .Also people with Secondary /secondary special education might face problem in loan repayment. Moreover, those who are living in house/apartment are facing difficulty in loan repayment (may be because of extra home loan, EMIs and so on).people opting for cash loan faces difficulty in doing the same

## [Suggestions](Suggestions)

- As we can see that many defaulters are labourers ,therefore bank should provide special privileges to those people like charging less interests(after proper documentation).
- For the people who have repaid the after cancellation ,feedback should be taken and proper reasons should be recorded
- Clients who were refused by bank for loan earlier have now turned into a repaying client. Hence documenting the reason for rejection could mitigate the business loss and these clients could be contacted for further loans.
